## The Scripts Directory

The .scripts directory contains my utility scripts, with a special emphasis on the bootstrap scripts for those who appreciate a quick and efficient setup process.

- **bootstrap.sh:** Installs all the important programs you may need. I use this whenever I deploy a new machine or vps.

## Installation

Clone this repo to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WillMatthews/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Symlink the dotfiles you wish to adopt into your home directory. For instance, to use the .vimrc:
```bash
ln -s $(pwd)/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

In my use, I just `mv` everything into my home directory. The .gitignore only includes the files in this repo, so it's easy to manage them. Other files in your home directory will not interfere.
```bash
cd dotfiles
mv * ~/
mv .* ~/
```


### Using Scripts
The scripts within the .scripts directory are designed for direct execution. For detailed usage instructions, consult the comments within each script or execute them with `-h` or `--help` for help information (if it is present!). 
Otherwise, each script will tell you what it does in a comment.

I include `.scripts` in my `$PATH`, which you can find in `.zshrc`.
If you don't want my `.zshrc` but still want to include `.scripts` in your `$PATH`, do:
```bash
export PATH=$HOME/.scripts:$PATH 
```

## Customisation
**Youâ€™re encouraged to fork this repository and tweak the dotfiles and scripts to your heart's content, tailoring them to fit your own preferences and workflow.
Make them your own!**

## Contributing
